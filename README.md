Existing music streaming apps just do not have all the features in it that I wish they had. So I figured why not dive deep into how audio and streaming software works, and try to build out my own music app with all the features that I'd like! Worst-case, I'll learn tons about audio streaming, audio processing, app development, and infrastructure for deployment and performance. Best-case, I learn all of that AND get a sweet customized music app :)
